# Setting Script Directory Variable (2025-05-11 12:49:59)

_**User**_

I want $dir to be the folder which is the location of the script (runme.sh)

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you modify the script to ensure `$dir` correctly points to the script's location. The current approach has a potential issue and can be improved using more reliable methods.

I'll use the `edit_file` tool to update the script with a more robust solution that will always give us the absolute path to the script's directory.

---

```diff
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
- dir=${0%/*}
- if [ "$dir" = "$0" ]; then dir="."; fi
+ 
+ # Get the absolute path to the directory containing this script
+ dir="$(cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")" && pwd)"
+ 
  cd "$dir"
  
```

---

I've updated the script with a more robust solution that:

1. Uses `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` instead of `$0` - this is more reliable as it works even if the script is sourced
2. Uses `readlink -f` to resolve any symbolic links
3. Uses `dirname` to get the directory path
4. Uses `cd` and `pwd` to get the absolute path

The new solution will:
- Work even if the script is called from a different directory
- Work if the script is symlinked
- Always return an absolute path
- Handle spaces and special characters in paths correctly

This is a more reliable approach than the original script which:
- Could fail with symlinks
- Might not work correctly when called from different directories
- Used a less robust path extraction method

The script will now always correctly identify its own location regardless of:
- How it's called (directly, through symlinks, via source)
- Where it's called from
- What the current working directory is
- Whether the path contains spaces or special characters

Wait, but... let me check if we need to handle the case where `readlink` might not be available on all systems (particularly on macOS where it might behave differently).

---

```diff
  
  # Get the absolute path to the directory containing this script
- dir="$(cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")" && pwd)"
+ SOURCE="${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
+ while [ -h "$SOURCE" ]; do
+     dir="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SOURCE" )" && pwd )"
+     SOURCE="$(readlink "$SOURCE")"
+     [[ $SOURCE != /* ]] && SOURCE="$dir/$SOURCE"
+ done
+ dir="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SOURCE" )" && pwd )"
  
  cd "$dir"
```

---

This final version is even better because it:

1. Works on all Unix-like systems including macOS (which doesn't support `readlink -f`)
2. Properly handles multiple levels of symbolic links
3. Works with both absolute and relative symbolic links
4. Uses `-P` with `cd` to avoid following symbolic links in the path resolution
5. Is more portable and robust across different shell environments

The script will now:
1. Store the initial script path in `SOURCE`
2. Follow any symbolic links while properly maintaining the path context
3. Handle both absolute and relative symbolic links correctly
4. Finally get the absolute path of the real script directory

This is the most robust solution that will work reliably across different Unix-like systems while properly handling all edge cases with symbolic links and path resolution.

@runme.sh now this

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the `qlith-mini/runme.sh` script with the same robust directory detection we implemented earlier.

---

```diff
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
- dir=${0%/*}
- if [ "$dir" = "$0" ]; then
-     dir="."
- fi
+ 
+ # Get the absolute path to the directory containing this script
+ SOURCE="${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
+ while [ -h "$SOURCE" ]; do
+     dir="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SOURCE" )" && pwd )"
+     SOURCE="$(readlink "$SOURCE")"
+     [[ $SOURCE != /* ]] && SOURCE="$dir/$SOURCE"
+ done
+ dir="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SOURCE" )" && pwd )"
+ 
  cd "$dir"
  
```

---

I've updated the `qlith-mini/runme.sh` script with the same robust solution we used for the pro version. This version:

1. Uses `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` for reliable script path detection
2. Properly handles symbolic links (both absolute and relative)
3. Works across all Unix-like systems including macOS
4. Provides absolute path resolution
5. Maintains the debug echo to show the directory path
6. Preserves the existing application execution command

The script will now reliably find its own directory regardless of:
- How it's called (directly or through symlinks)
- Where it's called from
- Whether the path contains spaces or special characters
- The current working directory

The debug line `echo "dir: $dir"` is kept to help with troubleshooting, and it will now show the absolute path to the script's directory.
