This fl8.html stuff is not needed at all

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll fix the issue where qlith-mini is trying to open a non-existent "fl8.html" file instead of the specified file. Let me examine the source code that handles command line argument processing.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory qlith-mini/browser • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📄 `mainwindow.cpp` |
| 📄 `main.cpp` |
| 📄 `CMakeLists.txt` |

</details>

---

Let's check the main.cpp file first as it likely handles the command-line arguments:

---

Read file: qlith-mini/browser/main.cpp

---

Now let's look at the mainwindow.cpp file to see how the load function works:

---

Read file: qlith-mini/browser/mainwindow.cpp

---

Now let's check the QlithWidget code:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory qlith-mini/src • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📄 `container_qpainter.h` |
| 📄 `container_qpainter_p.h` |
| 📄 `qlith_global.h` |
| 📄 `CMakeLists.txt` |

</details>

---

Read file: qlith-mini/src/qlithwidget.cpp

---

Now I have a good understanding of the issue. In the QlithWidgetPrivate::loadLocalFile function, there's code that attempts to open the file and reports an error if it fails. The error message we're seeing is from this function:

```cpp
void QlithWidgetPrivate::loadLocalFile(const QString &filePath) {
    QFile file(filePath);
    if (file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly | QIODevice::Text)) {
        QString html = QString::fromUtf8(file.readAll());
        loadHtml(html, QUrl::fromLocalFile(filePath));
    } else {
        qWarning() << "Failed to open file:" << filePath << " - " << file.errorString();
        emit q->loadFinished(false);
    }
}
```

The problem is that the script is processing basic_layout.html, but for some reason, the application is trying to open "fl8.html" instead. This suggests there might be some hardcoded path or value somewhere in the code.

Let's look at the container_qpainter.cpp file to see if there's any reference to "fl8.html" there:

I've found the issue! Let's check the qlith-mini/runme.sh file:

---

Read file: qlith-mini/runme.sh

---

I found the problem! In the `qlith-mini/runme.sh` file, there is a hardcoded call to the qlith application with the specific fl8.html file:

```bash
"$dir/build/browser/qlith.app/Contents/MacOS/qlith" "$dir/../test_files/fl8.html"
```

This is why the application is trying to open fl8.html even when we run the main examples/runme.sh script. The script is overriding any command-line arguments with a hardcoded path to fl8.html.

Let's modify the qlith-mini/runme.sh file to accept command-line arguments rather than using a hardcoded file:

---

```diff
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
+ # this_file: qlith-mini/runme.sh
  
  # Get the absolute path to the directory containing this script
```

```diff
  cd "$dir"
  
- "$dir/build/browser/qlith.app/Contents/MacOS/qlith" "$dir/../test_files/fl8.html"
+ # Check if an HTML file was provided as an argument
+ if [ "$#" -ge 1 ]; then
+     html_file="$1"
+ else
+     # Default file if none provided
+     html_file="$dir/../test_files/basic_layout.html"
+ fi
+ 
+ # Execute the qlith application with the specified HTML file
+ "$dir/build/browser/qlith.app/Contents/MacOS/qlith" "$html_file"
  
```

---

Now let's also check the equivalent file in qlith-pro to make sure it doesn't have the same issue:

---

Read file: qlith-pro/runme.sh

---

Let's update the qlith-pro/runme.sh file in the same way:

---

```diff
  dir="$(cd -P "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" && pwd)"
  
- echo "Running in debug mode"
+ echo "Running qlith-pro"
  echo "Current directory: \"$dir\""
  echo "Application directory: \"$dir/build/qlith-pro.app/Contents/MacOS\""
  
- # Run with debug environment variable
- # QLITH_DEBUG=1
- "$dir/build/qlith-pro.app/Contents/MacOS/qlith-pro" "$dir/../test_files/fl8.html"
+ # Check if an HTML file was provided as an argument
+ if [ "$#" -ge 1 ]; then
+     html_file="$1"
+ else
+     # Default file if none provided
+     html_file="$dir/../test_files/basic_layout.html"
+ fi
+ 
+ # Execute the qlith-pro application with the specified HTML file
+ "$dir/build/qlith-pro.app/Contents/MacOS/qlith-pro" "$html_file"
  
  # "./qlith-pro/build/qlith-pro.app/Contents/MacOS/qlith-pro" "./test_files/simple.html"
```

---

Now try running the main examples/runme.sh script again:

---

```bash
cd ~/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/qlith && ./examples/runme.sh | cat
```

```
adam@Hamlet qlith % cd ~/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/qlith && ./examples/r

_**Assistant**_



---

It seems the fixes to the individual runme.sh scripts haven't resolved the issue. The main examples/runme.sh script is still indirectly causing qlith-mini to look for fl8.html. Let's examine and fix the examples/runme.sh script:

---

Read file: examples/runme.sh

---

Looking at the script, it seems the issue isn't with the examples/runme.sh script itself. It's directly calling the qlith/qlith-pro binaries with the correct parameters. 

The most likely explanation is that the `main.cpp` in qlith-mini is ignoring the command line arguments and trying to load fl8.html anyway. Let's modify the main.cpp file to fix this:

---

Read file: qlith-mini/browser/main.cpp

---

The main.cpp looks correct - it's parsing command line arguments properly and should use the provided file path.

Let's look at the qlithwidget.cpp implementation again:

The error message shows that the qlith-mini application is still trying to load a file at "/Users/adam/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/qlith/qlith-mini/../test_files/fl8.html". This suggests there's still a hardcoded reference to this file somewhere.

Let's check the container_qpainter.cpp file to see if there's a hardcoded path:

Read file: qlith-mini/src/container_qpainter.cpp

Let's add debugging capabilities to the application to help us understand exactly what's happening:
