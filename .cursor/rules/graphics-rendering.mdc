## Core Components

### Gradient Generation System
- Custom multi-color gradient interpolation with supporting linear, radial and conic gradients
- Progressive alpha blending with defined thresholds (60% start, 80% end, 17 steps)
- Special handling for inner/outer radius adjustments in radial gradients
- Support for gradient color stop sorting with stable sort implementation
File: `qlith-pro/src/gradient.cpp`

### Shadow Effects Engine
- Multi-layered shadow composition with configurable spread and blur
- Custom shadow calculation algorithm for rectangular and float-based adjustments 
- Shadow extent calculations with configurable outline sizes
- Normal and custom shadow style support
File: `qlith-pro/src/shadowdata.cpp`

### Color Processing Pipeline
- HSL to RGB conversion with specialized color space transformation
- Color blending logic with progressive alpha thresholds
- Custom multiplier calculations for light/dark color variants
- CMYK to RGBA conversion with specific color space adjustments
File: `qlith-pro/src/color.cpp`

### Image Handling System
- Custom frame timing control with catch-up logic for delayed frames
- Specialized frame caching system for large animations (>5MB threshold)
- Frame metadata tracking with deferred loading
- Memory budget tracking with observer notification system
File: `qlith-pro/src/bitmapimage.cpp`

### Rendering Context 
- Custom quad/rect mapping functions for graphics coordinate transformations
- Special case handling for graphics-related transformations (scale, rotate, skew)
- Graphics coordinate system conversions between different spaces (2D/3D)
- Perspective component isolation and manipulation
File: `qlith-pro/src/transformationmatrix.cpp`

## Business Value
- Domain-specific implementations for web content rendering
