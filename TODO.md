Be inventive and in `test_files` write a series of self-contained HTML files with embedded CSS that explore the limits of the CSS parser and layout engine. 

First write a FILES.md in there and make a list of the files you’re going to create. Briefly describe what each file will do/test. Note: each file should not be a "unit test" but instead a small example that combines various aspects of HTML+CSS including layout. Make sure to explore all aspects supported by litehtml. 

Once you’ve written FILES.md in the test_files folder, start writing the actual HTML files. Make each self-contained, so they include CSS and HTML. They may even include small base64-encoded PNGs.
