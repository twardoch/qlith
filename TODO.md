# TODO

1. DONE: Analyze the `examples` folder. This folder contains a series of example HTML files. 

2. DONE: Check `./qlith_mini/runme.sh` and `./qlith_pro/runme.sh`. They show how to run the two apps that are based on litehtml. 

3. DONE: Extend the CLI of both apps (mini and pro): --svg path should render the widget into SVG, --png path should render the widget into PNG. If any of these switches is used, the app should quit after the rendering is done. The switches can be combined.

4. DONE: Write a `./examples/runme.sh` that will run both tools and for each will read every HTML file in the `./test_files` folder, render it to both PNG and SVG, and save the output to the `./test_files/mini` and `./test_files/pro` folders respectively.
